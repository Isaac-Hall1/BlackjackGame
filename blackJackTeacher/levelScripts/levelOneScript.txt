/ Welcome to **blackJackTrainer. In this lesson we'll be looking at how to make decisions based on your cards. We'll also learn the rules and some basic strategy.
/ In a casino, each table will use between 1 and 8 standard 52 card decks. This trainer will use only a single deck, which provides the least advantage to the dealer.
/ Here's an example of the initial deal
* deal player hand spadeKing
* deal dealer hand heartEight
* deal player hand diamondTen
* deal dealer hand heartNine
/ The goal of blackjack is to make you hand as close to 21 without going over
/ Going over is called a bust and means that you lose your bet.
/ In this scenario, you've been dealt a pretty great hand- 20 off the bat!
/ Here, you will not want to draw any extra cards. Click stand to signal that you are done taking cards
/ In a casino, every player will take one action, either hit or stand before the dealer shows their second card. This second card is called the hole card.
/ In this case the hole card was a...

/ A nine. This brings the dealer's total to 17.
/ In most tables as well as this training, the dealer must stand when they achieve anything above a 16. 
/ In this case the dealer would stand and any players with a hand over 17 win their bet, and any with exactly 17 will get their bets returned.

* deal player hand diamondFive
* deal dealer hand diamondEight
* deal player hand spadeTen
* deal dealer hand heartSix
/ In this case you have a pretty terrible hand. You should hit.
* deal player hand spadeSeven
/ This is a bust on your end. Unfortunately, that means you lose your bet.
/ The dealer can also bust, in which case you would win your bet, unless you also went bust.
* shuffle
/ Let's talk about splits:
/ A split occurs when you are dealt two of the same card.
/ A split divides your hand into two one card hands that you can play off of.
/ Both hands will hit. You will then hit on one side of the split until you are ready to stand, then move to the next
* deal player hand heartEight
* deal dealer hand spadeTwo
* deal player hand spadeEight
* deal dealer hand clubTen
/ You recieved two eights. You should always split on eights, because a 16 is not a good final hand against the dealer.
/ In a scenario where you hit on the two eights, your return on your bet is .48, meaning you will lose 52% of the time.
/ When you split, you will have to pay to play on that second hand. It will cost however many chips your first hand cost.
/ Go ahead and split your hand
* deal player hand heartQueen
* deal player split diamondSeven
/ Some casinos allow resplitting, so you would be permitted to split to a third hand if you got another 8.
/ This rule is dependent on the table though, and at ours, you may only split once
/ Both of these hands are passable. You could try to hit on the second hand, but your odds are pretty bad. 
/ You should stand
* reveal hole
* deal dealer hand diamondFour
/ In this scenario, your 1st hand wins and your second hand loses. 
/ In a casino, you would lose the bet on the losing hand, and win the bet on the winning hand.
/ The only other hard and fast rule around splits is to always split on aces. Your total if you kept hitting on the two ace hand would be only 12
/ Which puts you in a horrible position with 16 cards that could cause you to go bust still in the deck.
/ Always split on Aces!
* shuffle
/ Now we get to the name of the game. When the player or dealer is dealt a natural two-card 21, it is considered a blackjack. 
/ Blackjack is a special card state that beats all other hands, including a 21 from a hit, or a ace split being dealt a 10. 
* deal player hand clubAce
* deal dealer hand heartKing
* deal player hand clubQueen
* deal dealer hand clubSeven
/ The suit doesn't matter for a blackjack. All you need is to have that 21 total off of your first two cards.
/ Some casinos pay 3:2 when you get a blackjack, however this is generally for tables where the house is dealing from many decks at once.
/ Let's see the dealer's hand

/ Congrats on your win!
/ That is it for the first level of **BlackjackTrainer. Please continue to level two where we will teach you how to play around the dealer's hand.
