### Purpose: The purpose of this educational app is to teach beginner-level blackjack. It takes you through three levels where in the first it teaches the user the fundamentals, the second it teaches the user about splitting, and in the third it teaches the user about dealer probability and how to play around the dealer. There is also a free play mode as the last level which allows the user to put all of the lessons into practice.
### Presentation: [Presentation of our BlackjackGame](https://youtu.be/ZHUQc9RAz2E).
### My Responsibilities: My responsibilities included programming all of the game logic, this means that any decision the player or the dealer could make was programmed and allowed by me. As well as the game logic, I did some work on the UI. I was assisted in programming the initial game logic with Josh Gundersen, and slightly assisted with programming the splitting logic with TJ Hess.
